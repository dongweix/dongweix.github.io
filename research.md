##### Labor Adjustment Cost: Implication from Asset Prices (Job Market Paper)

- Check out the [paper](/archive/dongweixu_jmp.pdf)

- This paper explores the relation between a firm’s labor input and its equity return, and studies its implications on macroeconomics and asset pricing. At the firm-level, a 1 percent increase in hours is associated with a 0.6 percent decrease in future equity return. A production-based asset pricing model rationalizes this empirical fact with labor adjustment cost on hours and adjustment cost shock that lowers adjustment cost. A positive adjustment cost shock encourages adjustment in the economy and hence redistributes consumption to investment. Firms adjusting hours more and taking advantage of lower adjustment cost are able to pay out more when marginal utility is high. Therefore, these firms are less risky and earn lower equilibrium return. Estimation of the model matches firm-level moments, pooled distributions, and equity return predictability of hours and employment growth. Adjustment cost shock recovered from the model captures a countercyclical component in business cycle fluctuation, and affects firm-level real quantities favorably and asset prices negatively.

##### Labor Commitment

- This paper proposes a economic mechanism that matches both the procyclicality of hours and countercyclicality of risk premium. Central to the mechanism is labor commitment, a measure of representative agent’s growing, income-generating stock of labor. When utility is nonseperable between consumption and labor and intratemporal elasticity of substitution is high, intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS) in equilibrium increases when labor-consumption ratio growth rate increases. I find empirical evidences supportive of predictions from IMRS, and obtain reasonable estimation of equilibrium coefficients. I further test the model in asset pricing context. Firstly, I demonstrate that the equilibrium stochastic discount factor (SDF) implied linear factor model performs fat better than various models and about as good as Fama-French three-factor model in explaining cross-sectional portfolio excess returns. Secondly, in conditional linear factor setting, I show that using labor-consumption ratio growth rate as conditional variable improves more than using cay or durable consumption growth, in all models considered.
