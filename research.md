##### Labor Adjustment Cost: Implication from Asset Prices (Job Market Paper)

- Check out the [paper](/archive/dongweixu_jmp.pdf)

- This paper explores the relation between a firmâ€™s labor input and its equity return, and studies its implications on macroeconomics and asset pricing. At the firm-level, a 1 percent increase in hours is associated with a 0.6 percent decrease in future equity return. A production-based asset pricing model rationalizes this empirical fact with labor adjustment cost on hours and adjustment cost shock that lowers adjustment cost. A positive adjustment cost shock encourages adjustment in the economy and hence redistributes consumption to investment. Firms adjusting hours more and taking advantage of lower adjustment cost are able to pay out more when marginal utility is high. Therefore, these firms are less risky and earn lower equilibrium return. Estimation of the model matches firm-level moments, pooled distributions, and equity return predictability of hours and employment growth. Adjustment cost shock recovered from the model captures a countercyclical component in business cycle fluctuation, and affects firm-level real quantities favorably and asset prices negatively.

##### Labor Commitment

- This paper proposes a novel economic mechanism that matches the procyclical labor hours and countercyclical risk premium. Central to the mechanism is labor commitment, a measure of representative agent's growing, income-generating stock of labor. When utility is nonseparable between consumption and labor, the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS) in equilibrium increases when the labor-consumption ratio growth increases. I find empirical evidence supportive of predictions from IMRS and obtain reasonable equilibrium coefficients in structural estimation using U.S. postwar aggregate data. I examine implications from the economic mechanism in asset pricing tests. First, the equilibrium stochastic discount factor implied unconditional linear factor model performs about as good as Fama-French three-factor model in explaining cross-sectional portfolios. Second, the labor-consumption ratio growth as the conditional variable improves various unconditional models more than cay and durable consumption growth.
