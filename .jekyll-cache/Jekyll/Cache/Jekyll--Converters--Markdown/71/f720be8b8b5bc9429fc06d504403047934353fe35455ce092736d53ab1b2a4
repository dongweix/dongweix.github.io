    <p>Teaching courses and interacting with students have been an essential and inspiring part of my graduate life. The privilege to teach a course to a group of students provides the most incredible opportunity to spark studentsâ€™ passion for exploring, extend their understanding of real-world phenomena with rigorous approaches, and encourage their new ideas and interesting questions. Therefore, throughout my graduate life, my goal in teaching economics in general, and macroeconomics and empirical econometrics in particular, is to help students develop conceptual economic intuition with real-world data and factual evidence.</p>
