    <p>This paper studies the asset pricing implications arising from the labor adjustment cost. I implement a novel crosswalk linking three micro-level datasets and measure the hours margin of a firmâ€™s labor input. At the firm level, a 1 percent increase in hours is associated with a 0.6 percent decrease in future equity value. A production-based asset pricing model incorporating non-convex, linear, and convex labor adjustment cost components matches key firm-level moments of real quantities and asset prices. Consistent with the data, the model implies that (1) firms face labor adjustment costs mostly in the form of disruption to production and that (2) a macroeconomic shock that reduces labor adjustment costs leads to high marginal utility states.</p>
