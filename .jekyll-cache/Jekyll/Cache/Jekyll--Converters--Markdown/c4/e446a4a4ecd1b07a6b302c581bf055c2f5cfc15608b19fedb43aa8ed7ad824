    <p>This paper explores the relation between a firmâ€™s labor input and its equity return, and studies its implications on macroeconomics and asset pricing. At the firm-level, a 1 percent increase in hours is associated with a 0.6 percent decrease in future equity return. A production-based asset pricing model rationalizes this empirical fact with labor adjustment cost on hours and adjustment cost shock that lowers adjustment cost. A positive adjustment cost shock encourages adjustment in the economy and hence redistributes consumption to investment. Firms adjusting hours more and taking advantage of lower adjustment cost are able to pay out more when marginal utility is high. Therefore, these firms are less risky and earn lower equilibrium return. Estimation of the model matches firm-level moments, pooled distributions, and equity return predictability of hours and employment growth. Adjustment cost shock recovered from the model captures a countercyclical component in business cycle fluctuation, and affects firm-level real quantities favorably and asset prices negatively.</p>

    <p>I propose a novel economic mechanism that matches the procyclical labor hours and countercyclical risk premium observed in business cycle fluctuations. I first build a neoclassical model utilizing the concept of labor commitment, a measure of a representative agentâ€™s growing, income-generating stock of labor. In the model, the utility is nonseparable between consumption and labor. Hence the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS) in equilibrium increases in the labor-consumption ratio growth. I next validate the model using U.S. postwar aggregate data and test the modelâ€™s mechanism via the lens of asset pricing. I examine implications of the economic mechanism using cross-sectional equity returns. I find that, the equilibrium stochastic discount factor implied unconditional linear factor model performs about as well as the Fama-French three-factor model in explaining cross-sectional portfolios. FUrthermore, I find that conditioning on growth in the labor-consumption ratio improves various unconditional models more than <em>cay</em> and durable consumption growth.</p>

    <p><strong>The Hours Premium in U.S. Asset-Pricing</strong> I study the relation between hours growth and equity return from the household side in a representative agent framework. This paper proposes a single macroeconomic factor based on the growth in hours of aggregate labor input, and examines whether this macroeconomic factor represents a source of risk. I start from the empirical observation that the hourly wage and salary has been relatively flat for several decades and build a theoretical framework with limited participation in asset markets. The model is consistent with the story in which fluctuations in aggregate hours is a source of aggregate risk because of a limited risk-sharing mechanism between households whose consumption is mostly supported by labor income and those who support their consumption by both labor and asset income. Supported empirically, the single risk factor explains about 70-percent of Fama-French 25 portfolios equity returns.</p>

    <p><strong>Firm-Level Political Risk in China</strong> In this project, I investigate how much and what kinds of political risks are associated with Chinese firms. The paper start by defining and measuring political risks. Using web-scraping and textual analysis, I construct my dataset including Chinese firms that are either listed in NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX, or traded in Over-The-Counter (OTC) markets as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Therefore, the dataset contains a broader universe of Chinese firms that are available in the standardized financial reporting system. Then firm-level political risks are quantified as the intensity of political risks-related discussions in a firmâ€™s quarterly conference call participated by both the management team and the institution analysts. Next, I validate the empirical definition and measurement, and obtain the following preliminary results. First, the implied aggregate time-series of political risks recovered from my dataset resembles the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index in China with a correlation coefficient of 0.53 and varies intuitively over time. I categorize the political risks associated with the management teamâ€™s presentations to be voluntary disclosure and those associated with institution analystsâ€™ questions to be market following. My result suggests that the political risks derived from voluntary disclosure are twice as large as the political risks derived from the market following. This result is surprising in that traditional views would suggest voluntary disclosure be not informative due to associated private and social costs.</p>
